# The following section of the script had a conceptual error.
# You cannot combine flows and individual trips in the same way.
# The previous script was trying to generate individual trips from a flow,
# which is not how SUMO works. Let's provide a correct, simple way to achieve your goal.

# Corrected approach: Let's use two separate flows to handle this.
# A flow of 700 regular cars and a separate flow of 100 stopping cars.
# The stop behavior will be added automatically by the SUMO router based on the lane type.

# Note: Your network file must have a valid path for the stopping cars to take.

# The `from` and `to` attributes in the `<trip>` tags must use the correct edge IDs.
# The error on line 36 was trying to use a variable name `from` which is a reserved keyword.
# We will use the correct way to specify these attributes as part of a dictionary.
